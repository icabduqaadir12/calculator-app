## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

### What I Learned

- Creating a theme toggle using `<input type="radio">` and a slider-style UI
- Dynamically changing CSS variables via `body` class
- Responsive layout using CSS Grid and media queries
- Improving accessibility by using keyboard-navigable radio inputs

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to:

- Save selected theme to `localStorage` so it persists on reload
- Improve keyboard accessibility (Tab + Enter)
- Add keyboard input support (e.g., pressing numbers on the keyboard)
